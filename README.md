# Toileportation

Allows you to use the power of the Golden Throne

## Features

- **Teleportation:** Allows you to teleport to other Golden toilet location including the ones inside business.
- **Balancing:** As this mod is too op but is needed for end-game efficiency, Increased the price of Golden Toilet from **$50,000 -> $80,000**.
- **Shop stock:** Increased the stock you can purchase from the jewelry from **1 -> 2** (RESTOCKS EVERYWEEK)
- **Custom UI:** Thanks to [this discord](https://discord.gg/QMzd7u6yZb), I learned how to created prefabs for custom UIs.
